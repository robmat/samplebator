Behind the "If Only" app there is an opportunity for all designers 
to develop product design solutions for everyday problems faced 
by people with long term chronic conditions. The competition will 
market the most innovative product designed - this is an opportunity 
to test your design skills and make a difference. <b>If you're up for 
the challenge read on.</b>
<br/><br/>
The aim is to get people with chronic conditions to upload video 
demonstrations; sharing their experience of the practical problems 
with everyday objects. These videos are viewable on our website and 
through this app. Designers must first view these videos, and then 
develop an original product that could solve any of the issues demonstrated.
<br/><br/>
We encourage designers to draw upon their creative talents using novel ideas, 
materials and techniques to design remarkable products.
Designers are asked to send their blue prints, plans and descriptions 
via the 
<b><a href="http://www.ifonlyitworked.com">if Only website - www.ifonlyitworked.com</a></b><br/><br/>
The winning product will be decided by a panel of experts. This design will 
be developed into a marketable product and available to the public.
