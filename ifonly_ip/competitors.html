Behind the "If Only" app there is an opportunity for all designers to 
develop product design solutions for everyday problems faced by people 
with long term chronic conditions. The competition will market the most 
innovative product designed -this is an opportunity to test your design 
skills and make a difference. If you're up for the challenge read on.</b>
<br/><br/>
The aim is to get people with chronic conditions to upload video demonstrations 
sharing their experience of the practical problems with everyday objects. 
These videos are viewable on our website and through this app. Designers 
must first view these videos, and then develop an original product that 
could solve any of the issues demonstrated.
<br/><br/>

We encourage designers to draw upon their creative talents using novel ideas, 
materials and techniques to design remarkable products.Designers are asked 
to send their blue prints, plans and descriptions via the if Only website -
